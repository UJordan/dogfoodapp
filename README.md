# The Dog Food App

## Our Group Project

Christa Cooper - https://github.com/usmc-Blockhead

Hayln Anderson - https://github.com/hayln-alaine

Jordan Ulves - https://github.com/UJordan

We are students at NuCamp Coding Bootcamp and decided to work together on this project from start to finish.

The idea:

Hayln knows of a Non-profit in her area that takes in dogfood donations and redistributes it to those that need it.  Right now they have no Inventory control method of keeping track of what they have on hand, so we decided to try make them one.

The Wireframe we came up with during the planning meeting was out guiding

GitHub: We used version control to work together thru GitHub, using branches and pull requests with protection rules to prevent code overwriting by each other
